	<p class="movieDetail" Mismatched is an Indian Hindi-language coming-of-age romantic drama television series on Netflix, based on Sandhya Menon's 2017 novel When Dimple Met Rishi. It was adapted by Gazal Dhaliwal and directed by Akarsh Khurana and Nipun Dharmadhikari. It is produced by Ronnie Screwvala's RSVP Movies.[1] Starring Prajakta Koli, Rohit Saraf, Rannvijay Singha and Vidya Malvade in prominent roles, the series is about Rishi, a die-hard romantic who believes in traditional ways of dating, who falls for Dimple, a gamer, and eventually wants to marry her.

Dhaliwal adapted the novel in early 2018, with the script being tweaked for the series. While the novel is set in the United States, the story was adapted to take place in Jaipur. The series features cinematography handled by Avinash Arun and Milind Jog, with editing done by Sanyukta Kaza and Namrata Rao. Mismatched features a soundtrack album composed by Jasleen Royal, Samar Grewal, Anurag Saikia, Prateek Kuhad, Shashwat Singh, Taaruk Raina, Deepa Unnikrishnan, Abhijay Negi and Hiphop Bhaiya, with Saikia also composing background score for the series.

The series premiered on 20 November 2020, through the streaming platform Netflix.[2] It received a positive response from audiences, with critics praising the chemistry of Saraf and Koli, the performances of the cast, music and background score. However, the writing and the direction was criticized.

The series was renewed for a second season on 3 March 2021. Season 2 premiered on Netflix on 14 October 2022.[3] Season 3 premiered on Netflix on 13 December 2024.</p>
